\subsection{Comments about the module}
The software engineering module taught me valuable skills about team work and the true meaning of friendship. It has been an enjoyable experience and I can only hope working in teams in the real world is as pleasant as this has been. 

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
I have learned and applied useful and practical skills that are sure to assist me in my future career as a computer scientist. Learning how to better communicate in teams of people I hadn't had the opportunity before and working together under pressure to produce good quality work that we are all proud of. I have learned the importance of communication and working under a leader, cooperating and collaborating whilst remaining calm and friendly with one another. Using diagrams and plans I am confident in methods used to plan and develop software and know that knowledge of these methods will help me through the actual development phase in the future.

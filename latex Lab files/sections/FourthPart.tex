\section{Fourth Member}
This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
This module gives me a break from all the coding stuff with the idea of communication and planning in computing. The best part of the module is probably the lecture recordings and labs(?). Recordings help me reinforce my understanding of the lectures. And what I like about labs(minus the assessed labs) is that I met new friends. I don't really know anyone in the course except the girls who are also doing the course.

\subsection{Selfie with Max}
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

%You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref$. you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

% My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
I guess I have learnt the importance of teamwork(?).
